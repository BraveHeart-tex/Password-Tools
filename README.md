# Password / Passphrase Generator & Tester

While checking out Bitwarden’s password tools, I thought—why not try building it myself? So I set out to create my own version of their password/passphrase generator and strength checker in just a few hours. It was a fun way to dive deeper into secure password practices and see how these tools work under the hood.
